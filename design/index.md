# Clean design

Reduce visual clutter, keeping the number of fonts and colors low, add white space and line things up.

## Use grid

## Colors principles

- Keep your colors complimentary

- Use mostly neutrals + one brighter color for important bits.

- Find color paletes from setbsites like colourlovers.com

## Fonts

- Low number of fonts, 2 are ideal.
- Use fancy/display fonts sparingly - very cluttery.
- Vary weights (bold), style(italics), and transforms (uppercase, etc.) to differentiate bits.

## Add White spacing


# User experience

- What's the most important action on your design? Make It easy to find and use.

- Pay attention to your goals. Make them easy to find and use.

# Content principles

- Less is more. Big paragraphs are a sign of clutter.

- Break into bullets If you can.

- Add white space between paragraphs.

- Add bold to remark sections

## Headlines

- Talk benefits, not details. Keep It short. Use natural, friendly language.
