# Pillars of OOP

- Abstraction: Real word to classes
- Encapsulation: Hide functionality by private attributes and interfaces
- Inheritance: Children classes.
- Polymorphism: Use children or interfaces instead of the abstract class, to create objects.

# Relations

- Dependency: When a change in the definition of one class, result in modifications to the other class.
- Association: relation in which one object uses or interacts with another4
